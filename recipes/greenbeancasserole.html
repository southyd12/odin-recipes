   <h3>All the greens in order to stay lean</h3>
   <p>This is a great variation of the traditional green bean casserole.</p>
   <p>It's topped with French fried onions and Cheddar cheese.</p>
   <h5>Ingredients</h5>
   <ul>
       <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans green beans, drained</li>
       <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
       <li>1 (6 ounce) can French fried onions</li>
       <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
   </ul>
   <h5>Steps</h5>
   <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
       <li>Place green beans and soup in a large microwave-safe bowl. Mix well and heat in the microwave on HIGH until warm (3 to 5 minutes). Stir in 1/2 cup of cheese and heat mixture for another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer green bean mixture to a casserole dish and sprinkle with French fried onions and remaining cheese.</li>
       <li>Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven until the cheese melts and the onions just begin to brown.</li>
